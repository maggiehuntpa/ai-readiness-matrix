## Section 1 – is your organisation ready?
1.	How would you rate your organisation's data?
•	1: All over the place, disorganised, and in need of some management
•	10: Secure, organised, accessible and clean
2.	How would you rate your organisation's data architecture?
•	1: Opaque and disjointed
•	10: Logical, secure, transparent and collaborative
3.	How would you rate your organisation's Digital & Data budget?
•	1: Limited and limiting
•	10: Money is no object
4.	How would you rate your organisation's cultural readiness for AI technology?
•	1: We are generally resistant to change and prefer to work with proven technology and processes consistently
•	10: Actively pro-AI: everyone is excited, we use new technology all the time, and everyone is very well-informed about the risks, costs and benefits
5.	How educated and engaged are your wider team when it comes to working with Big Data, AI and other new technologies?
•	1: We are aware of the opportunities they present
•	10: We regularly openly and critically discuss the ethical implications, security implications and other costs/benefits and risk relating to new technology



## Section 2 – is your solution appropriate?
1.	How complex would you say your proposed solution is?
•	1: Simple: there is a clear path from trigger to result, with minimal decision points
•	10: There are a number of decision points, broad-ranging data to consider, and nuances to its output
2.	How much analysis is required to produce the output?
•	1: Minimal - binary decisions at every step, based on simple conditions
•	10: Huge swathes of data must be processed to produce predictions, and evaluate them before we action them
3.	How much more effective would AI be at delivering this result, than a human (or human team) of the same cost?
•	1: Neither faster, reliable nor more accurate
•	10: Extremely faster, more reliable and more accurate
4.	How would you rate the longevity of the solution and its benefits?
•	1: Short-term - an immediate win for an immediate problem
•	10: Long-term - there is scope for the solution to address and evolve alongside a permanent challenge
5.	How easy will the solution be to integrate into existing platforms and technologies?
•	1: Challenging - the data and associated architecture requires cleansing and re-work before we can deploy such a solution
•	10: As easy as possible - the architecture, data and other facilities already exist for similar solutions
